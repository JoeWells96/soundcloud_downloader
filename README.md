# Soundcloud Downloader
Small rust cli tool to download mp3s from soundcloud.
Currently, only works for soundcloud tracks which have download option enabled.

Made as an experiment to learn some rust

Inspired by https://github.com/flyingrub/scdl

## Possible Improvements
- Better error handling
- Download tracks which do not have downloading enabled via ffmpeg and hls streams
- Progress bar
- Download all tracks in a playlist / users like list
